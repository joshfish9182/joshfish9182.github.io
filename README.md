## Automated Laser Manufacturing Test Platform (Master’s Thesis)


::contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}


**Overview**  
Designed and automated a lab-scale laser manufacturing test platform supporting research in selective laser melting and surface modification. The system replaces a manual, script-driven workflow with an integrated control and monitoring solution focused on repeatability, safety, and data integrity.

**Problem**  
The existing system required operators to manually run multiple scripts in sequence, creating opportunities for:
- Operator error  
- Inconsistent test conditions  
- Poor reproducibility  
- Inefficient experimentation  

**Solution**
- Automated multi-step test sequences using a unified control interface  
- Integrated laser control, galvanometer scanning, and motorized focus adjustment  
- Added sequencing logic, safety interlocks, and state validation  
- Enabled consistent test execution across users  

**Technical Highlights**
- ±10 V analog control of 2-axis galvanometer system  
- Coordinated laser triggering and motion timing  
- Automated focus positioning for repeatable melt plane alignment  
- Data acquisition supporting surface roughness and morphology analysis  

**Tools & Technologies**
- LabVIEW (automation, UI, sequencing)
- Python (data processing and analysis)
- Analog & digital I/O
- Precision motion systems
- Optical surface metrology

**Why this belongs on a Test Engineer resume**  
This project demonstrates **system integration, validation, troubleshooting, and automation**—not just research.
